In addition to learning how to learn in an efficient manner, I was able to obtain another valuable skill; namely, how to optimize my learning process in group settings through collaborative learning. With a collective approach to abstracting complex concepts I was able to not only help myself, but my team members as well. Working in a collaborative environment also enhanced my soft skills.</p>

                            </a>
                            <p> I stumbled into the audio sector because the opportunity presented itself, and I picked up the trade pretty quickly. I began my audio journey as a studio intern at Manhattan Beach Recordings. After a six-month tenure there, I began to work independently, mainly in live sound at several local bars in the Brooklyn area. In addition to live sound work, I ran a plethora of vocal tracking, mixing, and song-writing sessions for various artists; most notably, Wale, DreamDoll, Playboi Carti, Jada Kingdom, and Skepta. As an audio engineer, I had to work in rapidly changing environments all the time, which allowed me to better hone my adaptive skillset. Working with electrical circuitry was a significant part of my work; from repairing tweeters, replacing transducers in microphones, replacing circuit boards on mixing consoles, soldering damaged wires and much more. Here is a list of studios I've worked in: Manhattan Beach Recordings, Quad Studios, Power Station at BerkleeNYC, Platinum Sound Recordings, and Jungle City Studios.</p>

                            <p>As an entry-level jeweler/setter at Riva, I had to learn to read blueprints and implement them into actual pieces.

Working as a jeweler in a factory was extremely challenging; due to the fast working pace and high-quality standard, but it's where I discovered my love for problem-solving.</p>

                                <p>Project Summary: I developed a robust scientific calculator application in Java that operates through the CLI. The project showcases clean object-oriented design principles and includes advanced mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic. I implemented a custom parser for handling complex mathematical expressions and utilized JUnit for comprehensive testing. To ensure easy deployment, I configured Gradle build automation, allowing users to run the calculator via a simple JAR file. This project demonstrates my ability to create practical, user-friendly tools while maintaining code quality and deployment efficiency. <a target="_blank" class="anchor-text" href="https://github.com/Nautevol07VII-111/aLaboratory/tree/main/Java%20Calculator%20app/src"><em><b>Calculator</b></em></a></p>
